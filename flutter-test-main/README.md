# Connou UG (Haftungsbeschr√§nkt) Flutter Counter App

This Flutter project is a simple counter application based on the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture. The counter value can be incremented, and we'll be adding the ability to decrement it. When the counter goes negative, the text color will turn red.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://.../connou-test.git
    cd connou-test
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the App:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

4. **Explore the App:**

    - The app will open, displaying the current counter value.
    - Press the "Increment" button to increase the counter.
    - [To be implemented] Press the "Decrement" button to decrease the counter.

## Task: Add Decrement Functionality

- Implement the ability to decrement the counter in the CounterHandler cubit.
- When the counter goes negative, change the text color to red in the UI.
